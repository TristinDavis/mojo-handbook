The purpose of this project is to compile a corpus of documentation
for Mojo/Mojolicious.

As much as possible this is to be reused for Mojolicious
distribution. As that happens, the copyright should be reassigned to
Mojolicious distribution author and it should be issued under the same
conditions as the rest of the package, under its release managers decisions.

The authors of the original material retain the rights to republish
this in different context, so any contributors should probably
contribute to the version or subsection accepted in the Mojolicious
contribution - this is just a scratch pad, YMMV. You have been warned.

All the mistakes are ours, what is true can be only found in the code
(and perhaps reference docs).
